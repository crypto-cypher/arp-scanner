# arp-scanner
A simple bash script to scan common networks with ARP requests to steal a found internal IP address, if DHCP does not automatically assign one on startup.

Dependent on [arp-scan](https://github.com/royhills/arp-scan)
Could be modified to steal MAC addresses using [macchanger](https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger) if required
